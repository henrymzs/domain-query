# Project Domain Check (To use an external API) 

Practical Web Programming Activity

The goal was to create a simple website. The goal was to develop only the frontend of the project to practice the concepts taught in class and use an external API where suggestions were given. The Registro.br API was chosen, where the user enters a URL and the website checks and returns the data from that URL to the user. The project was initially built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and after a migratory period to React.

After the initial completion of the project using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I migrated to React out of curiosity, to learn a little more about how it works and also for study. I think it's a really cool tool and this is a start where I'll practice a lot more using React to build cool things.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used:
- React
- Vite
- Registro.br
- CSS
- JavaScript
